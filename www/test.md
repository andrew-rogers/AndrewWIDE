Quadratic Equations
===================

Finding roots by factorisation method
-------------------------------------

If a quadratic can be easily factorised then its roots can easily be found. For example, $y=6x^2-14x-12$ can be factorised to
$y=(3x+2)(2x-6)$. Its roots can be found for $y=0$ when $3x+2=0$ and $2x-6=0$, thus the roots are $x_0=-2/3$ and $x_1=3$. The roots can be verified by substitution in the quadratic equation.

\begin{align}
  y(x)& = 6x^2-14x-12\\
  y(-2/3)& =6(-2/3)^2-14(-2/3)-12\\
  & = 24/9+28/3-12\\
  & = (8+28)/3-12\\
  & = 36/3-12\\
  & = 12-12\\
  & = 0\\
  y(3)& = 6(3)^2-14(3)-12\\
  & = 54-42-12\\
  & = 0
\end{align}

The equation method (if that's what it's called!)
-------------------

Roots of a quadratic equation, $y=ax^2+bx+c$, can be found by the following equation:

$$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

Let's try it by setting $a=6$, $b=-14$ and $c=-12$:

\begin{align}
  x& = \frac{14\pm\sqrt{14^2+4\cdot6\cdot12}}{2\cdot6}\\
  & = \frac{14\pm\sqrt{196+288}}{12}\\
  & = \frac{14\pm\sqrt{484}}{12}\\
  & = \frac{14\pm22}{12}\\
  x_0& = \frac{14-22}{12}\\
  & = -8/12\\
  & = -2/3\\
  x_1& = \frac{14+22}{12}\\
  & = 36/12\\
  & = 3
\end{align}
