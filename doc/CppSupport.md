C++ Support
===========

C++ sections are supported using WasmDSP. The execution of C++ functions on server is no longer being developed and will eventually be removed.

Page Preprocessing
------------------

The page preprocessor extracts the C++ source code from the page sections and creates a function for each section. The functions are written to a .cpp file

Master Page
-----------

Not yet implemented. Eventually replaces Makefile or at least auto-generates it.

* Table of contents
* wasm import definitions
* Global C++ variables and functions shared with all pages
